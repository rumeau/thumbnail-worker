## Thumbnail Worker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rumeau/thumbnail-worker.svg?branch=2.0-dev)](https://travis-ci.org/rumeau/thumbnail-worker)

This worker was initially created to work with Elastic Beanstalk but i have modified it a bit
so it can be used anywhere, once installed, it only needs a custom message to work on the image
requested an create the thumbnails sizes desired.
